3. Draw a block diagram, truth table and logic circuit of 1\*16 Demultiplexer and explain its working principle.

### Attempt any eight questions: (8 x 5 = 40)

4. Perform the arithmetic operation (+42)+(-13) and (-42)-(-13) in binary using the signed -2's-complement representation for negative numbers.
5. Express the complement of the following function in sum of minterms.

   F(A,B,C,D) = ∑(0,2,6,11,13,14)

6. Reduce the following function using k-map

   F = wxy + yz + xy'z + x'y
