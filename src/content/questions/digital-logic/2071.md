   Convert the 3EC816 into different numbering system that you know.
2. Design the mod-6 asynchronous counter and explain with truth table.
3. What is demultiplexer? Draw its block diagram and explain its working principle.

### Attempt any eight questions: (8 x 5 = 40)

4. Convert the hexadecimal number 2BFC to binary and then to octal.
5. Proof the De-Morgan 1st and 2nd theorem with truth table and logic gates.
6. Simplify, the following Boolean function using three variable K-map.

   - a) F(X,Y,Z) = ∑(0,3,2,5)
   - b) F(A,B,C) = ∑(0,2,4,5,6)
