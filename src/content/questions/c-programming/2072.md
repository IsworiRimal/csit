2.  Discuss logical operators along with the truth table. Write a program using switch
    statement to display EXCELLENT, VERY GOOD, GOOD, SATISFACTORY, or FAIL if
    the user enters A, B, C,D,E respectively. (3+3)
3.  What do you mean by entry-controlled and exit-controlled loop? Write a program to
    print the following output.(2+4)

    $$
    \begin{matrix}
    1 \\
    0 & 1 \\
    1 & 0 & 1 \\
    0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
    1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
    \end{matrix}
    $$

4.  Differentiate break statement with continue statement. What is the output if the
    following program ? (2+4)

    ```c
         #include<stdio.h>
         #include<conio.h>
         #include<math.h>

         Void main()
         {
         int x=2, n=5, sum=0, i;
         clrscr();
         for(i=1; i<=n; i++)
         {
         If(i%2==0)
         Sum==sum-pow(x,i);
         else
         sum=sum+pow(x,1);
         }
         Printf(“sum=%d”,sum);
         Getch();
         }
    ```

5.  Explain pass by value and pass by reference with suitable example of each. (6)
6.  What is array? Write a program to find the sum of each row of 3\*2 matrix.
7.  What is dynamic memory allocation? Write a program to find sum and average of n
    numbers entered from the keyboard using dynamic memory allocation to create array
    to store these n numbers.(2+4)
8.  Discuss different file openings modes. Write a program to read all the numbers from
    the input file “value.dat” and store only even numbers in an output file named as
    “result.res”.(2+4)
9.  Discuss with example any five graphics function used in c-programming. (6)
