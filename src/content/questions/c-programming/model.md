1. Define function and list its advantages. Describe the difference between passing arguments
   by value and passing arguments by address with suitable program. [4+6]
2. Explain how structure is different from union? Make a program using structure of booklist
   having data member's title, author, and cost. Enter four data and calculate total cost. [3+4+3]
3. Explain various modes in which file can be opened? Write a program to CREATE and WRITE N
   numbers in a file "NUMBER.TXT" . Open this file then read its content and put all even numbers
   in one file "EVEN.TXT" and odd numbers in another file"ODD.TXT". [2+4+4]

### Attempt any eight questions: (8 x 5 = 40)

4. What do you mean by a problem analysis? What are the properties of a good algorithm? Explain the
   Compilation and Execution of any C program? [1+1+3]

   input is exactly divisible by 5 or 11 using nested if else statement? [2+3]
6. List various binary and unary operators used in C? Write a program that uses "while"loop to compute
   and prints the sum of a given numbers of squares. For example, if 4 is input, then the program will print
