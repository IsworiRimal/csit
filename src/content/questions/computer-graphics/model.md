### Attempt any two questions: (2 x 10 = 20)

1. Explain the working details of DDA algorithm? Explain. Digitize a line with end points
   A(6,12) and B(10,5) using Bresenham’s line drawing algorithm.
2. How can polygons be clipped? Why is Phong shading also called Normal Vector
   Interpolation scheme? Explain.
3. Given a window bordered by (1,2) at the lower left and (16,12) at the upper right, give the
   screen coordinates of a triangle with vertices (3,2), (10,7.5) and (5,5) when mapped into a
   viewport with corners (100,100) and (400,200). Provide accurate illustrations of the window,
   viewport, and the untransformed and transformed triangles with your answer.

### Attempt any eight questions: (8 x 5 = 40)

4. How to animate a two dimensional figure using transformations? Explain with example.
5. What are the key issues prevalent in producing a Virtual reality scene? Describe the
   Binary Space Partition tree.
6. How can a polygon surface be filled using the Flood fill approach? Explain.
7. What is the significance of vanishing points in Perspective Projection? Explain.
8. Explain ambient light, diffuse reflection and specular reflection with examples.
9. Compute the midpoint of the Bezier Curve with control points p0 = (0,0,1), p1 = (1,0,1) and p2 = (1,2,0).
10. How does a polygon can be created in OpenGL? Illustrate with an example.
11. How does a video controller and a frame buffer jointly collaborate to produce graphical
    display on the screen, in case of a Raster Display?
12. Write short notes on (Any TWO) [2.5 + 2.5]
