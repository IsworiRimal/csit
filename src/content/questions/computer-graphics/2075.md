### Attempt any two questions: (2 x 10 = 20)

1. Define window, viewport and viewing transformation. Let ABCD be the regular window with A(20, 20),
   B(90, 20), C(90, 70),and D(20, 70). Find the region codes for end points and use Cohen Sutherland algorithm
   to clip the lines P(10, 30) Q(80, 90).
2. List any two disadvantages of BSP tree method in visible surface detection. Make a comparision between
   Painter's algorithm and A- Buffer algorithm.
