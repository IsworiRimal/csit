### Laboratory Works:

The laboratory should contain all the features mentioned in a course. The Laboratory work should contain at least following tasks

1. Program to demonstrate the Boolean Retrieval Model and Vector Space Model
2. Tokenize the words of large documents according to type and token
3. Program to find the similarity between documents
4. Implement Porter stemmer
5. Build a spider that tracks only the link of nepali documents
