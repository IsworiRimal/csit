### Laboratory / Project Work:

In the practical session, students will learn to use project management, CASE, and modeling tools. They also prepare a project report that includes at least analysis, design, and implementation phases of system analysis and design. The project can be done in groups with at most four members in each group using any suitable database, programming, and interfacing technologies.
