### Laboratory Work Manual:

Student should write programs and prepare lab sheet for most of the units in the syllabus. Majorly,
students should practice design and implementation of intelligent agents and expert systems,
searching techniques, knowledge representation systems and machine learning techniques. Students
are also advised to implement Neural Networks for solving practical problems of AI. Students are
advised to use LISP, PROLOG, and any other high level language like C, C++, Java, etc. The
nature of programming can be decided by the instructor and student as per their comfort. The
instructors have to prepare lab sheets for individual units covering the concept of the units as per the
requirement. The sample lab sessions can be as following descriptions;

#### Unit 2: Intelligent Agents (4 Hrs)
