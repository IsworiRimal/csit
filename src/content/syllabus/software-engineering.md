### Course Description:

This course familiarizes students with different concepts of software engineering mainly focusing
on software process models, agile development, requirements engineering, models, design,
implementation, testing, evolution, and software project management.

<br>

### Course Objectives:

The main objective of this course is to provide knowledge of different concepts of software
engineering so that students will be able to develop high quality software using different
software management skills.

### Laboratory / Project Work:

Students should prepare a project report along with software product using different concepts
of software engineering. The project can be done in groups with at most four members in
each group using any suitable database, programming, interfacing technologies, and project
management concepts.
