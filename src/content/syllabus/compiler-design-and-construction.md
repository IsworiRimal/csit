### Course Description:

This course is designed to develop acquaintance with fundamental concepts of compiler
design. The course starts with the basic concepts and also includes different phases of
compilers like lexical analysis, syntax analysis, syntax-directed translation, type checking etc.
in detail.

### Course Objectives:

- To develop knowledge in compiler design
- To develop lexical analyzers, parsers, and small compilers using different tools
- To develop lexical analyzers, parsers, and small compilers by using general purpose programming languages.

### Laboratory Works:

The laboratory work develops practical knowledge on different concepts of compiler design.
Students should

- Create a project by using lexical analyzer generator or any high level language
- Create a parser by using parser generator or any high level language
- Write programs for intermediate code generation and machine code generation
- Create front end of a compiler and using general purpose programming languages
