### Laboratory Works:

This course requires a lot of programming practices. Each topic must be followed by a practical
session. Some practical sessions include programming to:

- Create, compile and run simple C programs, handle different data types available in C,
  perform arithmetic operations in C, perform formatted input and output operations,
  perform character input and output operations.
- Perform logical operations, create decision making programs, create loops to repeat task.
- Create user-defined functions, create recursive functions, work with automatic, global
  and static variables, create, manipulate arrays and matrices (single and multi-
  dimensional), work with pointes, dynamically allocate de-allocate storage space during
  runtime, manipulate strings (character arrays) using various string handling functions.
- Create and use structures and files to keep record of students, employees etc.
