### Laboratory Works:

Students should able to perform at least one experiment from units 1, 2 and 5, 6, 7. The details of
the experiment will be provided in the manual below.

### Lab Manual

Students should perform at least 5 experiments (at least one from each groups) in a group of 2 students. They
should submit report of the experiment individually. Students should write their lab report of each experiment in
this format:

- Name of the Experiment:
- Apparatus Required:
- Theory/Working Formula
- Observation
- Calculation
- Result
- Error Analysis
- Discussion

**The list the experiments are as follows:**

1.  Determine the moment of inertia and angular acceleration of a flywheel.

    OR

    Study Bar Pendulum and find moment of inertia and angular acceleration about various fix points.

    OR

    Study Torsional pendulum and find moment of inertia and angular acceleration.

2.  Determine the capacitance of a capacitor by ac bridge (de-Sauty’s method).

    OR

    Study the characteristics of Zener diode its use as voltage regulation

    OR

    Design and study the parallel LCR circuits for finding the quality factor of the elements.

3.  Study the temperature dependence of resistance of a given semiconductor.

    OR

    Study and determine the band gap in metals and semiconductors using appropriate method.

4.  Study the drain and transfer characteristics of junction field effect transistor (JFET).

    OR

    Study RS-Flip-flop using breadboard.

5.  Design and Study the LOGIC Gates: NOT, AND, OR, NOR & NAND Using TTL. Also Study the Power Loss in NOT Gate.

    OR

    Study NAND/NOR gates as Universal logic gates.

**Evaluation:**

The duration of practical examination will be 3 hours. Students should perform one experiment,
took own observational data, calculate the result and interpret it using suitable error analysis. The internal and
external examiner (appointed by the Dean Office) will evaluate the performance in this format:

1. Experiment: 40%
2. Write-up: 30%
3. VIVA Examination: 30%
