### Course Description:

The course covers the basic concepts of object oriented programming
using C++ programming language.

### Course Objectives:

The main objective of this course is to understand object oriented programming and advanced C++ concepts such as composition of objects, operator overloads, inheritance and polymorphism, file I/O, exception handling and templates.
